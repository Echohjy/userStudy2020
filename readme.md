### At the very beginning, many thanks for participating in our study.
This document is aimed to help you build the environment required for running the study. 
As a whole, the whole program is written in Python, along with pyqt5 and vtk.

If you have installed python3 and pip, then skip to *C*.

Else if you have installed python but not pip, skip to *B*.

Else, start from *A*.

### A. Install homebrew
1. Open the Terminal app. Type `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` 
Youâ€™ll see messages in the Terminal explaining what you need to do to complete the installation process.

### B. Install python and pip
1. Open the Terminal. Enter `brew install python`
2. Enter `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`

### C. Install pyqt5 and vtk

1. Open the Terminal and enter: `pip install pyqt5` and `pip install vtk`

### D. Run the program

1. In the Terminal, navigate to the study code folder. Enter: `python3 controller.py`

2. CHEERS! You should have seen the interface now!





# Windows User
Please first check your machine is 64-bit rather than 32-bit. The project requires 64-bit Windows.

How to check:

1. Open a file explorer window.
2. On the left, right-click This PC.
3. In the context menu, select Properties. Then the System Properties window opens.
4. In the System Properties window, find your System type.

If you have installed python and pip, then skip to *C*.

Else if you have installed python but not pip, skip to *B*.

Else, start from *A*.

If your operating system is 64-bit, then you could start setting up the environment. 

### A. Install Python
1. Install python from the official website: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/
Scroll down and select the version: *Windows x86-64 executable installer*

    REMEMBER TO INSTALL PYTHON IN A FILE YOU KNOW

2. Enter into the folder you have installed
    e.g. C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38


3. Add python path to the python executable file to the Path variable.

    a. start the *RUN* box and enter *sysdm.cpl*

    b. this should open up the *System Properties* window. Go to the *Advanced* tab and click the *Environment Variables* button

    c. In the *System variable* window, find the *Path* variable and click *Edit* button

    d. Position your cursor at the end of the Variable value line and add the path to the *python.exe* file, preceeded with the semicolon character (;) For example, we add the following value: *;C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38*

### B. Install pip

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the study code folder

2. Run the following command: *python get-pip.py*

3. Add pip path into Path variable. Same procedure with StepA3. The example value would be: *;C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts*

### C. Install pyqt5 and vtk

1. Open a command prompt and enter: *pip install pyqt5* and *pip install vtk*

### D. Run the program

1. Download the whole directory from this page.

2. In the command prompt, navigate to the study code folder. Enter: *python controller.py*

3. CHEERS! You should have seen the interface now!
